\begin{enumerate}
	\item My current postdoc does not include any teaching activities. I was offered to teach for a semester in Egypt at El Galala University. In agreement with the University of Muenster and to support the scientific activity of my country of origin, I am giving this semester a 48h exercise sessions. It follows the book Calculus Fourth Edition by Robert T. Smith and Roland B. Minton.
	\item In 2018-2019, I had a teaching position at Université Paris Diderot which consisted of 96h of teaching.
	\item In 2015-2018, I was a teaching assistant at Université Paris Diderot with a teaching charge of 64h/year.
